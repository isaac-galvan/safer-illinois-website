      <h2>Privacy Questions and Answers Regarding the Safer in Illinois App</h2>
      <p>
        The Safer in Illinois App has been built from the first day with privacy as a foundation. We take three specific actions that promote privacy in the Safer in Illinois App: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Privacy by Design.</b> Everything we build has privacy, consent, and choice designed in from the beginning. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Audit.</b> We are engaging in an NIST 171 security audit of the App. We plan an additional audit during the 2020-2021 academic year that will compare our privacy goals and public statements to the functioning of the code. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Share and Engage.</b>  We share the results of these audits and campus and will state publicly how we intend to respond to any issues identified in the audits.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Below, we present questions about privacy and provide an answer for each.

                  There are different types of data stored and transmitted from the Safer in Illinois App. 
                  <ul>
                    <li>Personal identification, such as NetID, UIN, and cell phone number, are used to create user accounts on the Safer in Illinois App. This personal information is shared with Technology Services and is stored on the user’s phone as well as on account servers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The SARS CoV-2 test results that users can retrieve through the Safer in Illinois App are stored on their phones. The test result is saved encrypted in the secure database for the Safer in Illinois App in case users need to access their data from a new device.  The Safer in Illinois app does not share the test results with anyone.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The anonymous Bluetooth keys that are used as proximity records in the Exposure Notification system are stored on the phone for 14 days and then are automatically deleted. When a user has a positive test result, and if they have opted-in for Exposure Notification, 14-days of their Bluetooth keys are uploaded to a secure database server and then downloaded by other phones so that those phones can look for matches with the keys they have saved. These random keys are de-identified from the personal identity of users. The keys expire and are deleted automatically after 14 days from both the phones and the database server. The data is not saved anywhere else.

                  Only the infected individual will be notified of test results. The test result notification comes directly from the healthcare provider. The notification is encrypted in transit and decrypted on the user’s  phone. The test result is saved encrypted in the secure database for the Safer in Illinois App in case users need to access their data from a new device. No other party can decrypt the test result. Test results, whether they are negative or positive, are received only by the tested individual. The Safer in Illinois app will not share test results information with anyone. The laboratory that conducted the test is required by law to submit all test results to the Illinois Department of Public Health, which is managing the response to the epidemic.

                    What is contact tracing & exposure notification? Specifically, how is the Safer in Illinois app using track & trace technology to manage COVID-19 cases? 
                  </button>
                </h2>
              </div>

                <div class="card-body">
                  <p>Contact tracing is a public health procedure used to identify people who may have come into contact with an infected person. Public health workers who conduct contact tracing interview known infected individuals, attempt to find all recent contacts with the infected individual, and then follow up with those contacts with testing, isolation, treatment and other measures. </p>

<p>The Safer in Illinois app <b>does not</b> do contact tracing. The Safer in Illinois app has no way of knowing the identity of the other people who are using the app, or of knowing the identity of users who are infected. </p>

<p>The Safer in Illinois app provides <b>exposure notification</b>. Exposure notification lets people know if they were in the vicinity of someone who was later found to be infected. If users turn on exposure notification, their phones store Bluetooth-emitted encrypted tokens when they are in near proximity to other phones. If users of the app later find out they are infected, 14-days of their Bluetooth keys are uploaded to a secure database server and then downloaded by other phones so that those phones can look for matches with the keys they have saved. Phones that find matches notify their users that they might have been exposed. Exposure notifications are generated on each user’s phone. The notification is displayed only on the user’s phone. The exposure notifications are not reported to any other party. </p>

                    The Safer in Illinois app is designed for confidential proximity detection via Bluetooth. Are there plans to add geolocation tracking in future?

                <div class="card-body">
                  <p>No, there are no plans to add geolocation tracking. We have discussed digital geolocation tracking of infections, but it touches a hot button with members of our community. Many people are not interested in location tracking, for privacy reasons. If we were to implement location tracking, it would have to be as an opt-in opportunity only. </p>

<p>One reason to have location tracking of infections is that it would be very useful in curbing infection hotspots or super spreader events. But we are unlikely to offer location tracking in the Safer in Illinois app unless we can do it in an anonymous fashion, so that we're not sharing any individualized data, in order to protect privacy. </p>
